## New Era of AI Regulation

The EU AI Act has entered its full enforcement phase, making the European Union the first major jurisdiction to comprehensively regulate artificial intelligence systems. Companies operating AI products and services within the EU must now comply with a tiered risk-based framework.

## Key Requirements

High-risk AI systems — including those used in healthcare, law enforcement, and hiring — must now undergo mandatory conformity assessments, maintain detailed technical documentation, and provide clear explanations of how automated decisions are made.

General-purpose AI models, including large language models, must disclose their training data sources and implement safeguards against generating illegal content.

## Industry Response

Major tech companies have spent the past 18 months preparing for this moment. Google, Microsoft, and Meta have all established dedicated EU compliance teams, while smaller companies have turned to third-party compliance platforms that have sprung up to meet demand.

Some industry voices have expressed concern about potential innovation chilling effects, but EU Commissioner for Digital Affairs noted that "responsible innovation and regulation are not enemies — they are partners in building trustworthy technology."
