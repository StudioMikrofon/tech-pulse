## Pushing the Limits of Physics

TSMC has officially unveiled its N1 process technology, representing the world's first 1nm-class chip manufacturing process. The announcement, made at TSMC's annual technology symposium in Taipei, marks another milestone in the relentless march of semiconductor miniaturization.

## Performance Gains

The N1 process delivers approximately 40% better power efficiency compared to TSMC's current N2 node, along with a 25% boost in transistor density. This translates to either significantly longer battery life for mobile devices or substantially more computing power at the same thermal envelope.

## Industry Adoption

Apple, NVIDIA, and Qualcomm are expected to be among the first customers for N1 chips, with volume production planned for late 2027. The technology is expected to power everything from next-generation smartphones to AI accelerators and autonomous vehicle processors.

The breakthrough relies on a new Gate-All-Around (GAA) transistor architecture combined with novel extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography techniques that TSMC has been developing for over five years.
