## Breakthrough Results

Moderna has announced that its personalized mRNA cancer vaccine, mRNA-4157/V940, has achieved an 89% reduction in cancer recurrence in a Phase III clinical trial involving over 3,000 melanoma patients. The results, published in Nature Medicine, represent the most significant advancement in cancer immunotherapy in over a decade.

## How It Works

Unlike traditional vaccines that target infectious diseases, Moderna's approach creates a custom vaccine for each patient. The process begins with sequencing the tumor's DNA to identify unique mutations, then designing mRNA sequences that teach the immune system to recognize and attack cells carrying those specific mutations.

## Path to Approval

The FDA has granted the vaccine Breakthrough Therapy designation, and Moderna expects to file for regulatory approval by mid-2026. If approved, it would become the first commercially available personalized cancer vaccine.

> "We're entering an era where cancer treatment becomes truly personalized at the molecular level," said Dr. James Liu, Principal Investigator of the trial at Massachusetts General Hospital.

The company is already expanding trials to include lung cancer, bladder cancer, and pancreatic cancer patients.
