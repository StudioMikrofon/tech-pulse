## From Research Lab to Warehouse Floor

Boston Dynamics has officially launched its Atlas humanoid robot for commercial warehouse operations, marking the transition of the iconic bipedal robot from research platform to practical industrial tool. The first deployments are now active in Amazon and DHL facilities across the northeastern United States.

## What Atlas Can Do

The commercial Atlas model can navigate complex warehouse environments, pick and place packages of varying sizes and weights (up to 25kg), operate alongside human workers safely, and adapt to changing floor layouts without reprogramming. It uses a combination of LiDAR, stereo cameras, and a new tactile sensing system in its hands to manipulate objects with surprising dexterity.

## Economics of Humanoid Labor

Boston Dynamics is offering Atlas through a robotics-as-a-service (RaaS) model at approximately $8 per hour of operation — competitive with human labor costs in many markets while operating 20 hours per day with minimal downtime.

> "The humanoid form factor isn't just about mimicking humans — it's about operating in spaces designed for humans without requiring infrastructure modifications," explained Robert Playter, CEO of Boston Dynamics.

The company has reported a backlog of over 500 units on order from logistics companies worldwide.
