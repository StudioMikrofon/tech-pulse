## A New Record in Entertainment

Grand Theft Auto VI has officially launched and immediately shattered every entertainment industry record. Within its first 72 hours, the game generated $1.2 billion in revenue, surpassing even the most optimistic analyst predictions.

## The Living World of Leonida

Set in the fictional state of Leonida — Rockstar's reimagining of Florida — the game features the most detailed open world ever created in a video game. The map is roughly 2.5 times larger than GTA V's Los Santos and features dynamic weather systems, evolving neighborhoods, and an AI-driven NPC population that creates emergent storytelling moments.

## Technical Achievement

Running on Rockstar's proprietary RAGE 9 engine, GTA VI pushes current-generation hardware to its limits with real-time global illumination, photogrammetry-scanned environments, and a physics system that makes every interaction feel tangible.

Players have praised the game's dual protagonist system featuring Lucia and Jason, whose intertwining stories explore themes of ambition, loyalty, and the American Dream through Rockstar's signature satirical lens.
